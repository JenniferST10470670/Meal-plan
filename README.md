### Project Overview

The **[Meal-Plan] ** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [Introduction to Mobile Application]
The application was created using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio** and we had to incorporate the **If else statement** as part of the assignment 
The app’s purpose is to [ provide meal suggestion based on time of day for users]

## Purpose and Features
The application provide users with meal suggestions at a certain period of day, allowing users to have different meal options throughout the day.

### Key Features:
- **Feature 1**: The App screen provides clear feedback with minimal effort
- **Feature 1**: The App has maintainable code which involves clear logics and is well structured
- **Feature 1**: The App has a suggestion button which provide users with meal options also has a Reset Button which allows the input from users  to be cleared
  
## Design Consideration
- **Layout design and Accessibility**: allows users to engage with the app effortlessly with design element such as background image, font and colours which provides the app with a aesthetic 
     appeal
- **Simplicity**: A user-friendly screen designed for easy accessibility, with the incorporation of different widgets and added functionality users are provided with meal suggestion instantly 
 
## GitHub and GitHub Action Utilisation
The process of incorporating GitHub version control allowed us to track and manage code changes through commits and keep track of  

### GitHub Action
Through GitHub Action we perform testing to ensure the app's functionality 
Automate builds (both APK and AAB generation)
GitHub Action with test and run tests to ensure code correctness

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Login, e.g. implementing a login option  to  verify  the identity of users will allow better data storage.]
2. **Feature 2**: [Cater for different religions, e.g. Broadening the meal options to cater for all religions.]
3. **Feature 3**: [Adding Alarm, e.g., Adding a alarm feature allows users to not miss their meal option that certain time of day.]


## Challenges and Learnings

**Challenge 1**: [I had challenges with the implementation of the If Else statement and understanding how I could incorporate it within my code."]
 **Solution**: [ Through research I begin to understand the logics of statements and got additional help from my tutor who explained how I could use it in my code."]
 
 **Challenge 2**: [error handling when running the App for the first time."]
 **Solution**: [using the school manual and Mr kingcade Garanganga's lecture notes allowed me to fix the errors and showed me where I made mistakes.]
